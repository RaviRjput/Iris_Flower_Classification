# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using machine learning algorithms.

## ðŸ“Š Features
- Dataset: Iris flower dataset (sepal & petal measurements)
- Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ§  Goal
To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify a given flower based on its measurements.

## ðŸ“ˆ Output
- Model achieves high accuracy on test data.
- Visualizations to understand feature distribution and model performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb`
3. Explore the classification results and graphs
